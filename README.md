# Yet Another Weather App (YAWA)

## Installation
```
git clone *The Repo*
cd YAWA/YAWA
open YAWA.xcodeproj
```

## Development Details

- MVP Pattern (mostly ðŸ˜°)
- `ModuleConfigurator` for DI
- Shared `ViewService` for views creation

## Features

- Dark-mode gradients support (in run-time, try it out ðŸ˜Ž)
- No third-parties! (Swiftlint'd been used for "nit" commit)
- Cities cell's are so good to rest a thumb on 'em! ðŸ˜œ

## Things to Improve

- Localization
- Advanced view-builders (OMG `ViewService` _singleton_ RLY??7?)
- Appropriate tab's naming...
- Me, myself and I on interviews: "`Presenter` **prepares** data to display". Also me: "`ViewController`'s supremacy, muah-ah-huh! Tasty SLOCs! Om-nom-nom!"
